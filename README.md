## Overview
Traditional deep networks often over-fit to fine-scale textures, while unconstrained Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) suffer the same issue because their adaptive nonlinearities remain overly expressive. Our work tackles this by constraining KANs to a low-degree neuromanifold and pairing two feature-extractor branches with a novel Style Decorrelation Loss. The resulting model‚ÄîNeuroManifold-Regularized KAN (NMR-KAN)‚Äîlearns shape-fair representations that separate local and global cue processing, boosting shape bias by 14.8 pp over baseline convolutional KANs and delivering extra resilience to common corruptions and adversarial attacks.
